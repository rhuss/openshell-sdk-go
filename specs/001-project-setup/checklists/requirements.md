# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Setup and Build Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for clarification and planning.
- FR-001 through FR-004 mention specific tool names (Go, mise, golangci-lint) which is
  acceptable for a project scaffolding spec where the tools ARE the deliverable.
- Success criteria reference specific commands (make test, make lint) which is appropriate
  since this feature IS the build tooling.
