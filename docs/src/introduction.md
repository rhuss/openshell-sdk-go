# OpenShell Go SDK

The OpenShell Go SDK provides an idiomatic Go client for the OpenShell gateway API. It wraps the underlying gRPC protocol behind typed interfaces, making it straightforward to manage sandboxes, execute commands, handle providers, and more.

## Key Features

- **Sub-client pattern**: A single `Client` provides typed accessors for each API domain (Sandboxes, Exec, Providers, Files, Health, SSH, TCP, Config, Policy, Services)
- **Clean types**: SDK types are self-contained, so your code works with idiomatic Go types without extra dependencies
- **Fake client for testing**: An in-memory implementation of the full `ClientInterface` for testing without a live gateway
- **Watch and streaming**: First-class support for watching sandbox state changes and streaming command output
- **Typed error handling**: Functions like `IsNotFound`, `IsAlreadyExists`, and `IsConflict` for precise error classification

## Where to Start

If you are new to the SDK, the [Quick Start](getting-started.md) guide walks you through installation, connecting to a gateway, creating your first sandbox, running a command, and cleaning up.

For a deeper understanding of how the SDK is structured, see the [Architecture](architecture.md) overview.

## API Reference

Every SDK interface has a dedicated reference page with method signatures and code examples.
